\title{Calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index}
\usage{
hhi(x, "s")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the data frame}

\item{s}{Name of the vector (variable) from the data frame, x, corresponding with stored market share values}
}
\value{
hhi A measure of market concentration
}
\description{
Computes the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of a market/space, which is a measure of concentration, based on the share size of all individual firms/actors
}
\details{
Allows for placing the objects directly from working datasets (including, data frame and the market share variable name in quotes) into the function for intuitive usage.
}
\note{
The vector of "share" values should be comprised of integers corresponding to total share of individual firms/actors (e.g., df$s <- c(35, 40, 5, 10, 6, 4) # 6 firms totaling 100 percent of the market). The measure is often used as a measure of competition, where 0 is perfect competitiveness and 10,000 is a perfect monopoly.
}
\examples{
a <- c(1,2,3,4) # arbitrary firm id
b <- c(20,30,40,10) # market share of each firm (should total 100\% of market share)
x <- data.frame(a,b) # create data frame
hhi(x, "b") # calculate market concentration based on firms' share sizes
